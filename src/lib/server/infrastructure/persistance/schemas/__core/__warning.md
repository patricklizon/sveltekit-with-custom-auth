# Core schemas

> [!CAUTION]
> Modifying content within the `__core` directory requires extreme care and consideration.
> Any changes to these files can have widespread implications and potentially disrupt the entire template's functionality.

The core folders serves as the foundation of the template, housing critical components and essential functionality. It encompasses crucial features such as user management, authentication mechanisms, and fundamental logic that are integral to the template's operation.

To maintain stability and ensure compatibility, it is strongly recommended to avoid direct modifications to core schemas. Instead, if you need to extend or customize core functionality, create separate schemas that reference the core schemas. This approach allows for safer customization while preserving the integrity of the core components.

**Remember**: Changes to core schemas should only be undertaken by experienced developers with a comprehensive understanding of the template's architecture.
