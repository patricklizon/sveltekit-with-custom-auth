The core folders serves as the foundation of the template, housing critical components and essential functionality. It encompasses crucial features such as user management, authentication mechanisms, and fundamental logic that are integral to the template's operation.

If you need to extend or modify core functionality, consider creating custom modules that interact with the core through well-defined interfaces.
